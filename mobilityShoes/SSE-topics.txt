MOBILITY BEHAVIOR MONITORING
- Application => raw inputs:
  (1) *smartShoeSensors => UUID, pressureTimeSeries
  (2) calendar => UUID, activity(shopping, sport, cooking, gaming);
  (3) environment => UUID, environment(slippery, plain, slope, house, track);
- Output:
  (4) labels => UUID, anomalous(regular, anomalous)
- Features (net input)
  (a) Maximum pressureTimeSeries
  (b) Minimum pressureTimeSeries
  (c) Median pressureTimeSeries
  (d) Mean Absolute Deviation pressureTimeSeries
  (e) activity + small scatter
  (f) environment + small scatter
